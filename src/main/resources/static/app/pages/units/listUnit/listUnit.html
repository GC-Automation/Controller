                    You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have
                    to trust that
                    the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny,
                    life, karma,
                    whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

                    The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously
                    consider them as
                    believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the
                    way, and who
                    will be sharing the adventure with them.
